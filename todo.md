	* can i import directly from a cdn? yes - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/orbital-sys@1.0.3/sys.js/+esm

	- do proper testing / test suite

	- a 'meta' component for describing object metadata schemas would be nice

	- it would be nice if late registered observers could be fed earlier events; but this requires a database
	- arguably could add a volatile ram database at least; and or indexdb
	- arguably could add a mongo db binding

	- right now filtering is done very clumsily; would be better to pre-bake the filters

	- it might be nice to specify a profile rather than always having components like 'tick' which not everybody wants

	- philosophy: it might be nice to try think through this all a lot more; i feel like it is still fairly clumsy as an idea
